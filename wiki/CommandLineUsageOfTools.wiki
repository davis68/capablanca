#summary Overview of usage of ruylopez and other tools.

= Introduction =
`ruylopez`, `petroff`, and `polgar` are sequential programs which provide crystal structures for use in `capablanca`.  They are written in C++.

They have been tested with the Ubuntu (Lucid Lynx and later) and Fedora 11 GNU/Linux operating systems.

= Running `ruylopez` =
Usage is as `ruylopez [OPTION] ...` where the options are shown in the following table.
|| Option || Description ||
|| `-c CONFIG.CFG` || specify configuration file ||
|| `-C` || make problem cyclical in _x_- and _y_-directions ||
|| `-d` || suppress deposition ||
|| `-h` || display this help message ||
|| `-E `_P_ || specify potential _P_ ||
|| `-i `_T_ || specify _T_ steps between output files ||
|| `-N` || output XYZ file with neighbor count, not state ||
|| `-n` || force recalculation of nearest neighbors ||
|| `-p DATAFILE.XYZ` || specify particle position file ||
|| `-R `_s_ || specify random seed _s_ ||
|| `-r RULE_SET.RS` || specify rule set file ||
|| `-S` || force full surface calculation ||
|| `-s` || output surface at each time step as well ||
|| `-T `_t_ || specify temperature _t_ ||
|| `-t `_a_ || specify _a_ time steps to run ||
|| `-V` || use verbose output ||
|| `-v` || display version information ||
|| `-z `_Z_ || specify coordination number _Z_ ||

The output file is in the `xyz` file format, which specifies that the number of particles in the file be on the first line with each tab-delimited succeeding line consisting of an identifier and the _x_-, _y_-, and _z_-coordinates of that particle.

The configuration file consists of
