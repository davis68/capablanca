Vital
✔ report nu_+ and nu_- (by surface difference)
✔ track dissolved surface as well (for redeposition) (validate and expand)
✔ allow for defects + defect generator (incl. screw) (improved surface detection)
✔ the nn calc needs to be validated
✔ send state data in process_helpers.h
✔ expand the radius slightly (1.2?)
✔ track random seed
✔ clean up warnings and uint/int comparisons
✔ combine process_helpers.h and process.cpp
✔ fix half-layers in fcc/bcc in petroff
✔ figure out visualization (now using VMD)
✔ set "make all" to "make optimized" by default
∼ check uint/int comparisons in for statements (by max value type) in all files
✔ validate surface expansion functions
✔ add deposition rule set, differentiating prefactors and energies for deposition
✔ auto-detect lattice type
✔ fix initial surface-finding routine to something that's more general
✔ fix fcc/bcc nn count
✔ turn off initial surfaceB in ruylopez/petroff
✔ fix evolution of entire fcc system rather than a superficial layer
  
✗ create orthorhombic settings for ruylopez & petroff (necessary?  only a nn model)
  create vacancy defect generator
  
  

Small-scale
✔ incorporate better UPRNG/validation of ergodicity of rng-->convert to use Boost uniform_01
✔ find better optimal nn cell size (fails if cells too small for any particles)
✔ standardize file names and includes
  re-examine message passing in readXYZ() (& dropped particle)
∼ re-examine message passing in neighbors.cpp (but maintain bsend?)
✗ convert to use iterators, not indices of vectors
✔ add error-catching to input.cpp readxyz.cpp statistics.cpp
✔ update file formatting to make it uniform
✔ free allocated memory throughout
✔ check for previous addition of neighbors and simplify neighbor structure (for now)
  fix up makefile
✔ allow CLI specification of random seed
  test suite batch file
✗ output nn-list for previously processed xyz files---this was rejected because not enough info is local (what are states of all nn?)
✔ add forced recalculation of nearest neighbor lists flag
✔ put command line on first comment in xyz file
  

Medium
✗ single-processor mode (MPI_PROC_NULL)
  output types beyond xyz (cfg, pdb)
✔ test VMD or AtomEye
  dynamic temperature support
✔ dynamic findMaxNN()
  state dump/load for large simulations
✗ convert completely to STL
  streamline error handling
  more general rules (esp for diff species or multiple kinetic regimes)
✔ review original ppproj2009 for correct attributions of code
∼ make cyclicality a possibility
✗ separate warning and error symbols
✗ write sstream-accepting particle output procedure in particle.h to simplify xyz output
  

Wishlisted
  allow MD/MC particle motion w/ periodic recalculation of nn
  generalized proc topology rather than slices?
  
  load particles on one proc?
  matrix problem?
  
  contact Bill Tuohy re termination of 1.0.0 version
  
Test the readXYZ() dropped particle thing to see if it's in the reading (try the 27 particles in test.xyz).
